<summary>How to create a logo for your GitHub repository:</summary>
<br>

Logos are a great way to brand your GitHub repository. They can be used to showcase your personal brand, company, or project. You can create a logo using a graphic design tool like Adobe Illustrator, Figma, or Sketch. Once you have created your logo, you can export it as an SVG file and add it to your GitHub repository.

- With Figma: Visit [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) and create a new file. Design your logo using shapes, text, and colors. Once you are happy with your design, export it as an SVG file (Select your Logo with the mouse, right-click, and select copy as SVG). You can then add the SVG file to your GitHub repository.

<summary>How to create a profile README for your Git Hub account.</summary>
<br>

A profile README is a special repository that you can create on your GitHub account to showcase your work, skills, and interests. It is a great way to introduce yourself to other GitHub users and provide them with information about your projects, contributions, and achievements.

- Create a New Repository: To create a profile README, you need to create a new repository with the same name as your GitHub username. For example, if your GitHub username is `miles-advani`, the repository should be named `miles-advani`.

- Add a README File: Once you have created the repository, add a README file to it. You can use Markdown to format the content of the README file and include information about yourself, your projects, and your skills.

- Add a assets folder: Create a folder named `assets` in your repository. This folder can be used to store images, logos, and other files that you want to include in your profile README.
