<summary>How to create a logo for your GitHub repository:</summary>
<br>

Logos are a great way to brand your GitHub repository. They can be used to showcase your personal brand, company, or project. You can create a logo using a graphic design tool like Adobe Illustrator, Figma, or Sketch. Once you have created your logo, you can export it as an SVG file and add it to your GitHub repository.

- With Figma: Visit [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) and create a new file. Design your logo using shapes, text, and colors. Once you are happy with your design, export it as an SVG file (Select your Logo with the mouse, right-click, and select copy as SVG). You can then add the SVG file to your GitHub repository.

- Copy the Badge Markdown Code: Once your badge is customized, Shields.io will provide you with Markdown code. Copy this code.

- Paste the Badge in Your README File: Open your README.md file in your GitHub repository and paste the copied Markdown code at the desired location in the file.
